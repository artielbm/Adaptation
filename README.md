Supplementary xpp files for Ha and Sherman, "How Adaptation Makes Low Firing Rates Robust" [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28647913), [The article](https://mathematical-neuroscience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13408-017-0047-3).

The Morris-Lecar model with adaptation is defined in [ML.ode](./ML.ode).

The version with a SNIC, corresponding to Fig. 11 in the paper, is defined in [ML_SNIC.set](./ML_SNIC.set). 

The version with a Hopf bifurcation, corresponding to Fig. 12, is defined in [ML_Hopf.set](./ML_Hopf.set).
